Simple application for retrieving random jokes using REST API from "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/."

Here I have presented usage of clean architecture and modern software libraries that make development & maintance easier.

Application is built using:

- Data binding
- Navigation 
- Room
- Dependency injection with Koin
- Retrofit
- MVVM
